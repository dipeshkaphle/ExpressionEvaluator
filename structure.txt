  # We gotta parse a term first calling the term func
  # Term will include all the first variables of the Expr
  # Coz Identifier ->Factor -> Term
  # So well cover the cases based on the next token we get
  # If its a TokOp we then parse an expression again
  # If its TokAssign we parse expression as well
  # If we see nothing , then its just that term we'll return
  # This all will be done by the expression function
  Expression  <-  Term [+-] Expression
    | Identifier '=' Expression
    | Term



# Pretty much trivial tbh 
  Term <- Factor [*/] Term
    | Factor
  Factor <- Number
    | Identifier
    | [+-] Factor
    | '(' Expression ')'
